# TensorFlow Tutorial for Friedler Lab Group

This is an interactive tutorial for TF.  Slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ejGfg1zERaXjzUR2UW2dHeXR-ufcNweYtyhs88TZ-5U/edit?usp=sharing).  I introduce concepts specific to TF along with basic machine learning concepts such as the gradient descent algorithm/loss functions in the context of TF implementations.

To use this tutorial:

	- Open the TensorFlow Tutorial.ipynb in github
	- Follow the installation instructions at the top of the notebook
	- Clone the repo:

``` git clone https://github.com/dylan-slack/tf_tutorial.git ```
