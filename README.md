# TensorFlow Tutorial for Friedler Lab Group

This is an interactive tutorial for TF.  Slides can be found (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ejGfg1zERaXjzUR2UW2dHeXR-ufcNweYtyhs88TZ-5U/edit?usp=sharing)[here].  I introduce concepts specific to TF along with basic machine learning concepts such as the gradient descent algorithm/loss functions in the context of TF implementations.
